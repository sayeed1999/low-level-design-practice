# OData

OData (Open Data Protocol) is an open protocol by Microsoft, that defines a set of best practices
for building & consuming Restful APIs.

Data exposed by the OData service is described by an EDM (Entity Data Model), while JSON and AtomPub
are used for message encoding.

- get all entries
`GET /odata/companies`

- query for a specific entry, by providing its ID
`GET /odata/companies(23)`

- request the top 5 results, after skipping the first 10 entries
`GET /odata/companies?$top=5&$skip=10`

– Get the top 5 entries
`GET /odata/companies?$top=5`

- Get the total entry count (along with all the entries)
`GET /odata/companies?$count=true`

- Get entries where city = 'New York'
`GET /odata/companies?$filter=city eq 'New York'`

- Get entries where city contains 'York'
`GET /odata/companies?$filter=contains(city, 'York')`

– Order entries by company name
`GET /odata/companies?$orderby=Name`

- Return only the ID and Name of all companies
`GET /odata/companies?$select=ID,Name`

- Include also the Products produced by the companies
`GET /odata/companies?$expand=Products`

- Get all companies whose size is greater than 20 including the total result count.
Each company should also include their product information.

`GET /odata/companies?$filter=Size gt 20&$count=true&$expand=Products`

```sample response
{
  "@odata.context": "https://localhost:7004/odata/$metadata#Companies(Products())",
  "@odata.count": 3,
  "value": [
    {
      "ID": 1,
      "Name": "Company A",
      "Size": 25,
      "Products": [
        {
          "ID": 1,
          "Name": "Product A",
          "Price": 10
        },
        // -> more products by this company
      ]
    },
    
    // --> more companies and products here
  ]
}
