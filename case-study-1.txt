Background: You need to build a rest API where User can login and logout, 
User can upload a csv file with keyword. With each keyword software should 
perform a search to google with a network call. Result from the network call 
should be stored in database.

Question: What are the classes you might need in this software solution?

Answer:
1. User class (discuss with interviewer that we need role based control or not)
2. Role, UserRole class (add if RBAC asked)
3. If session based API, it will add more tables for storing user sessions (optional)
4. CsvUpload class (each entry for each upload of csv)
5. Results class (one to many with CsvUpload class)
6. Optionally store the CSV file in a file based system if data is crucial.
