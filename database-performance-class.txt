# Database Performance Masterclass

## Query Tips

- Don't use SELECT *

- Always use WHERE

- Index carefully
    Indexing improves read performance, but reduces write performance! **Keep in mind**

- Do use Transaction
    Useful for long running query

- Don't open large dataset
    You will be sucked!

- Use Parameterized Query
    SQL Injection

- Test on Large dataset
    Try to have as big dataset as prod in test env
    Indexing performance starts to appear after 1 million data

- Don't import bulk data with INSERT
    Unless strictly necessary

- Don't do SELECT max(ID) from Master when inserting in a Detail table
    Use SCOPE_IDENTITY, IDENT_CURRENT, avoid @@IDENTITY

- Do avoid Nullable columns unless necessary
    They consume an extra byte on each nullable column

- Don't use the TEXT datatype unless you are using it for really large data e.g images
    The TEXT datatype is not flexible to query, is slow and wastes a lot of space if used incorrectly

- Don't use TEMPORARY tables unless strictly necessary
    Often a sub-query can substitute a temporary table

- Use appropriate datatype (choose datatype size carefully) Varchar/nvarchar/char
    Use int instead of long unless necessary
    Use varchar (20) instead of varchar(max)
    Use varchar (50) instead of varchar(1000) at random

- Don't use ORM, but stored procedure
    For applications that need large scaling

- Don't use Trigger
    Learn why? Its almost always avoidable

- Don't use negative searches (age != 18)
    `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE RegionID <> 3` - Indexes doesn't work here even created on RegionID column

- Don't use FUNCTION in WHERE clause
    as it would not work with normal indexes

- Don't use ORDER BY on column that's not indexed!
    Order by on columns that isn't indexed makes the query too slow due to general iterating **Keep in mind**

- Avoid Join unless needed
    Why? Avoid if possible, not always. Like Normalization should be done only when needed.

- Avoid Aggregate functions unless needed
    Why? Avoid if possible, not always.

Best Practices on INDEXES

- **Try to reduce indexes on tables where there are much INSERT/UPDATE/DELETEs **
- **Try to increase indexes on tables where there are much READ operations **


## Index Types

- Heap table
    No index!
    Table without primary keys, e,g useful log storing table

- Clustered index
    Primary key. A table must have it

- Non-Clustered index
    Index except primary key e.g, unique key
    Pointer to the clustered index of B-Tree leaf

- Full Text Index
    allows you to create indexes on columns that are not indexable by the standard index types mentioned earlier
    study full text search for clarity e.g searching 'sayeed' in 'i am sayeed' in a column text.

## Index - Best Practices

- Understand the characteristics of the database (OLTP/OLAP)

- Observe the most frequently used queries (top 10-20%)
    Observe the joins in those queries to find the best columns to create indexes!

- Understand the characteristics of the columns used in queries
    E.g integer column, unique or not null column - good
    byte[] - bad

- ** Choose Optimal Storage Location for the index **
    For example, Storing a Non-Clustered index on a filegroup that is on a different disk
    than the table filegroup - can improve performance!
    Because multi disks can be read at the same time. **(VVI)**

- Large number of indexes on a table affect the performance
    But why??

- Indexing small tables might not be Optimal
    But small at what level (size/columns)?

- ** Indexes on VIEWS provide performance gains when the view contains
    aggregations, table joins or both.**

- Don't write multiple queries to update the same row, instead sync in one query

- ntext, text, image, varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and varbinary(max) data types
    cannot be used for indexing!


## Index Fragmentation

What is it?

## Index - Maintenance

### INDEX REBUILD or REORGANIZE?

- Fragmentation < 10% : no action required
- Fragmentation 10-30% : INDEX REORGANIZE
- Fragmentation > 30% : INDEX REBUILD
